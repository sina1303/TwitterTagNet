# TwitterTagNet
This dataset contains co-occurring hashtags on Twitter, focusing on three key feature types influencing hashtag virality:  Structural Features: Network metrics like centrality and PageRank. Semantic Features: Semantic similarity, polarity, and subjectivity. User Features: Follower count, activity level, and more.
Hereâ€™s the translation for the GitHub README section:

This dataset consists of two parts:
1. **Edge List**
2. **Feature List**

The feature list is provided both before and after normalization, allowing researchers to apply and test their preferred normalization methods. The edge list can be used to construct a graph and visualize the relationships between co-occurring hashtags. The feature list, which also includes hashtag labels, can be used with GNN algorithms for predicting and classifying viral and non-viral hashtags.
